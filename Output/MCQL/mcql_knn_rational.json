    "rationale": "1. First, we need to calculate the initial momentum of each ball before the collision. Momentum is given by the equation: \n   momentum = mass * velocity\n\n   For the 2 kg ball:\n   momentum = 2 kg * 5 m/s\n   momentum = 10 kg m/s\n\n   For the 4 kg ball at rest:\n   momentum = 4 kg * 0 m/s\n   momentum = 0 kg m/s\n\n2. Since momentum is conserved in collisions, the total momentum before the collision must be equal to the total momentum after the collision. This allows us to set up the following equation:\n   (2 kg * 5 m/s) + (4 kg * 0 m/s) = (2 kg * v1) + (4 kg * v2)\n   10 kg m/s = 2 kg * v1 + 4 kg * v2\n\n3. We also know that the coefficient of restitution for an elastic collision is given by:\n   e = (relative velocity of separation) / (relative velocity of approach)\n\n   Since the 4 kg ball is initially at rest, the relative velocity of approach is simply the velocity of the 2 kg ball (5 m/s). The relative velocity of separation is the difference between the final velocities of the two balls.\n\n4. Using the coefficient of restitution, we can set up another equation:\n   e = (v2 - v1) / 5\n   1 = (v2 - v1) / 5\n   v2 - v1 = 5\n\n5. Now we have a system of two equations:\n   10 = 2v1 + 4v2\n   v2 - v1 = 5\n\n6. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:\n   v1 = 1.66 m/s\n   v2 = 3.33 m/s\n\nTherefore, the velocities of the 2 kg and 4 kg balls after the collision will be approximately 1.66 m/s and 3.33 m/s, respectively."

Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the fluid inside the plant cells against the cell wall, which helps to maintain the rigidity and structure of the plant. Strong turgor pressure in the mesophyll cells would allow the leaf to be more rigid and therefore better positioned to absorb maximum light.\n3. The distractors provided do not accurately explain why a leaf may absorb maximum light. The presence of a thick waxy cuticle on the upper surface may help reduce water loss, but it does not directly impact light absorption. Similarly, the presence of chlorophyll in the epidermis and high concentration of water in the stomata are not directly related to maximizing light absorption by the leaf.\n4.

We can calculate the change in resistance per degree Celsius by subtracting the resistance at ice point from the resistance at steam point: 420 Ω - 400 Ω = 20 Ω.\n4. This change in resistance occurs over a temperature range of 100 degrees Celsius (from ice point to steam point).\n5. Therefore, the change in resistance per degree Celsius is 20 Ω / 100 = 0.2 Ω/°C.\n6. To find the room temperature at which the resistance is 406 Ω, we can set up the following equation: 406 Ω = 400 Ω + (room temperature - 0 °C) * 0.2 Ω/°C.\n7. Solving for room temperature, we get: room temperature = (406 Ω - 400 Ω) / 0.2 Ω/°C = 30 °C.\n\nTherefore, the room temperature would be 30 °C."

Next, we need to calculate the temperature difference between l0 and l100. This can be done by subtracting l0 from l100:\n   l100 - l0 = 23 cm - 8 cm = 15 cm\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the temperature per cm by dividing the temperature difference by the length difference:\n   Temperature per cm = 15 cm / 4.5 cm = 3.33 Â°C/cm\n\n4. Finally, we can calculate the temperature at lÎ¸ by multiplying the temperature per cm by the length at lÎ¸ and subtracting it from the temperature at l0:\n   Temperature at lÎ¸ = 8 Â°C - (3.33 Â°C/cm * 3.5 cm) = 8 Â°C - 11.66 Â°C = -3.66 Â°C\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the thermometer at lÎ¸ would be -3.66 Â°C, which can be rounded to -30 Â°C."

In this case, the heater changes the temperature of the room from 20°C to 40°C with energy usage of 20000 J. Since the mass of the air in the room is not given, we can assume a standard mass for simplicity.\n\n3. Assuming a mass of 1 kg (1000 g) for the air in the room, we can calculate the heat capacity using the formula:\n   Q = (1000g) * c * (40°C - 20°C)\n   20000 J = (1000g) * c * 20°C\n\n4. Solving for c:\n   c = 20000 J / (1000g * 20°C)\n   c = 1 J/g°C\n\n5. However, the answer choices are in J K-1, so we need to convert the units:\n   1 J/g°C = 1 J/K\n\n6. Therefore, the heat capacity of the air in the room is 1 J K-1, which is equivalent to 1000 J K-1 when considering the standard mass of 1 kg.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1000 J K-1."

    "rationale": "1. Addison's disease is a condition characterized by the destruction of the adrenal cortex, leading to a deficiency in the production of adrenal hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone.\n\n2. Cushing's syndrome, Graves' disease, and Conn's syndrome are all conditions that involve dysfunction of the adrenal glands, but they do not specifically involve the destruction of the adrenal cortex as seen in Addison's disease.\n\n3. Therefore, the correct answer is Addison's disease, as it directly relates to the destruction of the adrenal cortex."

    "rationale": "1. The production of ketones is a normal metabolic process that occurs when the body does not have enough glucose for energy and starts to break down fats for fuel. This can happen during periods of fasting, low carbohydrate intake, or intense exercise.\n2. Ketones are produced through the breakdown of fatty acids in the liver.\n3. Ketones are not produced as a result of sugar reduction, excessive protein intake, or as a normal part of carbohydrate metabolism.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is that the production of ketones is due to the breakdown of fats for fuel when glucose is not readily available."

    "rationale": "1. Unequal food distribution can result in food waste, as some areas may have an excess of food while others have a shortage, leading to spoilage and disposal of food that could have been used to address food insecurity in other areas.\n\n2. Unequal food distribution can also result in food insecurity, where certain populations or regions do not have reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.\n\n3. Additionally, unequal food distribution can contribute to malnutrition, as some populations may not have access to a diverse range of nutritious foods, leading to deficiencies in essential nutrients.\n\nTherefore, all of these outcomes can result from unequal food distribution."

Nuclear physics deals with the study of atomic nuclei and their interactions, not specifically elementary particles.\n3. Quantum physics deals with the study of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels, but it is not specifically focused on elementary particles.\n4. Astrophysics deals with the study of the properties and behavior of celestial objects and phenomena, not specifically elementary particles.\n5.
