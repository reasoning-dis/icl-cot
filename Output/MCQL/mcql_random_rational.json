The pH of a solution is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions, so the statement \"it has a pH of 7\" is not relevant in this context.\n3. While hydrogen chloride is a strong acid, its ability to dissociate and release hydrogen ions is hindered when dissolved in non-polar solvents like methylbenzene.\n4. The fact that it does not react with methylbenzene is not the reason why it is not acidic. The lack of free hydrogen ions is the key factor in this case."

Cushing's syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone cortisol, and it does not involve the destruction of the adrenal cortex.\n3. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones, and it does not involve the destruction of the adrenal cortex.\n4. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, and it does not involve the destruction of the adrenal cortex.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is Addison's disease, as it directly involves the destruction of the adrenal cortex."

If the adrenal medulla is removed, the rat's ability to withstand stress situations such as cold would be diminished because it would not be able to produce these stress hormones.\n3. The adrenal cortex, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland are also involved in the body's stress response, but the specific removal of the adrenal medulla would have the most direct impact on the rat's ability to withstand stress situations such as cold."

Ketones are produced through the breakdown of fatty acids, not through the reduction of sugars or the intake of excessive protein or carbohydrates.\n3. Therefore, the correct answer is that the production of ketones is due to sugar reduction instead of fats. This is a result of the body's need for energy when glucose is not readily available."

Malnutrition occurs when there is an imbalance of nutrients in the diet, leading to health problems.\n3. Hunger is the physical sensation of needing food, which can result from unequal food distribution.\n4. Food insecurity is the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life, which can also result from unequal food distribution.\n5. Therefore, all of these options are valid consequences of unequal food distribution."
