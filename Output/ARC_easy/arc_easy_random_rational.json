However, the presence of a cell wall is not the main distinguishing factor between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that a prokaryotic cell has no nucleus, which sets it apart from eukaryotic cells."

Therefore, if the second sound wave is louder, it means that its amplitude is greater.\n2. Frequency is the number of wave cycles that occur in a given time, and it determines the pitch of the sound. Since the question states that both sound waves have the same pitch, the frequency is the same for both waves.\n3. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points of a wave with the same phase, and it is not necessarily related to the loudness of the sound.\n4. Speed of sound is a constant value in a given medium, so it does not change between the two sound waves.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is amplitude, as it directly relates to the loudness of the sound."

This step is used to interpret the results of the experiments and draw conclusions based on the data.\n\n4. Publishing the results of previous research is the final step in the scientific process, where researchers share their findings with the scientific community.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is forming a question that is the basis of a hypothesis, as it is the starting point for a new scientific investigation."

        "rationale": "1. The correct answer is that the truck has a larger mass, which requires more force to stop. According to Newton's second law of motion, force is equal to mass times acceleration. Therefore, the larger mass of the truck requires more force to stop it in the same distance as the car.\n\n2. The statement that the car has better brakes is not the best explanation for why the car stops in a shorter distance than the truck. While better brakes may contribute to a shorter stopping distance, the primary factor is the mass of the vehicle.\n\n3. The statement that the car has a lower center of gravity is not the best explanation for why the car stops in a shorter distance than the truck. The center of gravity affects stability and handling, but it is not the primary factor in stopping distance.\n\n4. The statement that the truck has a longer wheelbase is not the best explanation for why the car stops in a shorter distance than the truck. The length of the wheelbase affects the turning radius and stability, but it is not the primary factor in stopping distance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the truck has a larger mass, which requires more force to stop, resulting in a longer stopping distance compared to the car."

Neutrons are also found in the nucleus of an atom, but the atomic number specifically refers to the number of protons, not neutrons.\n\n4. The number of electrons in the outer shell is related to the element's reactivity and chemical properties, but it is not what the atomic number refers to.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the number of protons in the nucleus."

In ecosystems, energy is constantly being cycled and transferred between organisms, so it is not simply recycled back into the environment without being used.\n\n4. The energy being dissipated as heat is the most likely way for energy to become unavailable in an ecosystem. As energy is transferred between trophic levels, some of it is lost as heat due to the inefficiency of energy transfer and the metabolic processes of organisms.

Louder cries indicate better health and strength: This is also incorrect because while louder cries may be associated with better health and strength, the main reason for the louder cries is to signal the need for more food from the parents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that parents respond by giving more food when young birds call louder, which helps to ensure their survival."

Fertilizers often contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but in this scenario, the focus is on the nutrient that is increased by both fertilizer use and crop rotation with legumes.\n2. Crop rotation with legumes is known to increase the availability of nitrogen in the soil because legumes have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use.\n3. Fertilizer use also increases the availability of nitrogen in the soil, as nitrogen is a key component of many fertilizers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is nitrogen, as both fertilizer use and crop rotation with legumes increase the availability of this nutrient in the soil. The other options (phosphorus, potassium, and calcium) are not specifically increased by both fertilizer use and crop rotation with legumes."

Cold temperatures would actually weaken hurricanes, as they thrive on warm ocean waters. Therefore, cold temperatures do not contribute to the strength of hurricanes.\n\n4. While air pressure does play a role in the formation and behavior of hurricanes, it is not directly added by oceans to make hurricanes strong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that oceans add heat and moisture to make hurricanes strong."

Similarly, the absence of a reproductive system in organisms in the phylum Porifera is not directly related to the absence of tissues and organization into organs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the structures absent in organisms belonging to the phylum Porifera are organs, as they do not have organized tissues that work together to form specialized structures."

This is because snow has a high albedo, meaning it reflects a large amount of sunlight.\n\n2. Absorbed: While some sunlight may be absorbed by the snow, the majority of it is reflected, especially in polar regions where the snow cover is extensive.\n\n3. Refracted: Refraction occurs when light passes through a medium and changes direction, but it is not the primary interaction of sunlight with a snow-covered surface.\n\n4. Scattered: While some scattering of sunlight may occur, the primary interaction with a snow-covered surface is reflection due to its high albedo.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that most of the sunlight that strikes a snow-covered surface in polar regions is reflected."

This lack of tilt would result in a consistent amount of sunlight reaching each part of the Earth, leading to no distinct seasons.\n3. The tilt of the Earth's axis is what causes the variation in the length of daylight and darkness, leading to the cycle of day and night. Therefore, if the Earth did not tilt, there would still be day and night.\n4. The tilt of the Earth's axis does not directly impact the presence of ocean tides, which are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.\n5. The tilt of the Earth's axis also does not directly impact the presence of the atmosphere, as the atmosphere is primarily maintained by the Earth's gravity and the composition of gases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that if the Earth did not tilt on its axis in relation to the sun, there would be no seasons."

While it is true that the hydrogen ion has lost its electron, the main reason for the smaller radius is the absence of the electron, not just the loss of it.\n\n3. The distractor \"The positively-charged hydrogen ion has gained protons\" is incorrect because the number of protons in the nucleus of a hydrogen ion remains the same as in a neutral hydrogen atom.

When a bell rings, it causes the surrounding air molecules to vibrate, creating sound waves that travel to the student's ears.\n\n2. Light waves are not responsible for carrying the sound of the bell to the student. Light waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation that allows us to see objects, but they do not carry sound.\n\n3. Electrical impulses are not responsible for carrying the sound of the bell to the student. Electrical impulses are signals that travel through the nervous system, allowing us to perceive and interpret the sound once it reaches the ears, but they do not carry the sound itself.\n\n4. Water molecules are not responsible for carrying the sound of the bell to the student unless the bell is underwater. In the case of the student hearing the bell, it is the vibrating air that carries the sound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is vibrating air, as it is the medium through which sound waves travel to the student's ears."
