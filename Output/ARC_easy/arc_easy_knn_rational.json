Nuclear energy is associated with the nucleus of an atom and does not travel in waves, and mechanical energy is associated with the motion and position of an object, not wave-like motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is light and sound."

As layers of these fine particles accumulate and are buried by additional sediment, the weight of the overlying layers compacts the lower layers, squeezing out any remaining water and air.\n3. This compaction causes the particles to solidify and bind together, forming shale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"compacting,\" as this accurately describes the process required to form shale.

This causes the wave to \"feel\" the bottom and slow down, which in turn causes the wave to compress and increase in height.\n2. This increase in height is due to the conservation of energy, as the wave's energy is transferred from its velocity to its height as it approaches the shore.\n3. The frequency and wavelength of the wave may change as it approaches the shore, but the primary effect of the decreasing velocity is an increase in wave height.\n4. The energy of the wave may not necessarily decrease as it approaches the shore, as the wave's energy can be transformed into increased height and potential for erosion.

Gene flow: Gene flow occurs when individuals from one population migrate and breed with individuals from another population, leading to a mixing of gene pools. In this scenario, the smaller, isolated group of plants is not receiving new genetic material from an outside population, so gene flow is not the primary mechanism responsible for the change in allele distribution.\n\n3. Mutation: While mutations can introduce new alleles into a population, they are random and may not necessarily be the primary mechanism responsible for the change in allele distribution in this scenario.\n\n4. Genetic drift: Genetic drift is the change in allele frequencies in a population due to random events, such as the bottleneck effect or the founder effect. In this scenario, the smaller, isolated group of plants is experiencing genetic drift due to the selective pressure imposed by the larger plant population.

This camouflage adaptation helps the bird avoid being detected and eaten by predators.\n\nThe other distractors are not relevant to the survival benefit of the bird's brown color in the forest. Attracting potential mates, finding food, and blending in with the sky are not directly related to the survival advantage of camouflage from predators.

Decreasing weight would not increase air resistance, as weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object and is not directly related to air resistance.\n\n3. Decreasing velocity would not increase air resistance, as air resistance is dependent on the speed of the object moving through the air. \n\n4. Changing shape may affect air resistance, but the specific change of increasing surface area is the most direct and relevant to the scenario of a skydiver using an open parachute.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is increasing surface area."

The Moon's rotation on its axis does not directly cause the change in its shape as seen from Earth. The Moon's rotation is synchronous, meaning the same side always faces the Earth, so it is the Moon's orbit around the Earth that causes the changing phases.\n\n3. The Earth's rotation on its axis does not directly cause the change in the Moon's shape. The Earth's rotation does cause the cycle of day and night, but it is the Moon's orbit around the Earth that causes the changing phases of the Moon.\n\n4.
